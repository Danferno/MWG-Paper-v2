\subsection{Matching Procedure Justification}
The treatment effect after matching can be calculated as in Equation \ref{eq:1te}, where $\hat{\alpha}$ is the estimated treatment effect, $T$ is the set of treated observations, $C$ that of the controls. $Y_{it}$ is the outcome value of interest for observation $i$ at time $t$. $w_j$ is the weight assigned to each control observation. In matching without replacement and without ties this would be either one or zero. In matching with replacement and or ties this can be any real value larger than zero. These weights sum up to the number of treated observations.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1te}
    \hat{\alpha} = \sum_{i \in T} \Delta Y_{i, 15} - \sum_{j \in C} w_j \Delta Y_{j,15}
\end{equation}

In line with synthetic control method studies (e.g. \citealp{Abadie2006, Dube2015}), we assume $Y_{it}$ can be modeled in a multi factor error structure (see e.g. \citealp{Chudik2015, Bai2009}) as in Equation \ref{eq:2mfs}. $\alpha_i$ is the firm-specific treatment effect, $D_t$ is one from 2015 onwards and zero before, I(..) indicates whether the firm is treated. $c_i$ is a firm-specific fixed effect, $\delta_t$ is a period specific common shock and $\epsilon_{it}$ is a mean zero (time-varying) idiosyncratic shock. $F_t$ is a time-varying economy wide shock that affects each firm differently, according to their specific factor loading $\lambda_i$. There can be a potentially large number of these, but for ease of exposition we stick to one.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2mfs}
    Y_{it} = \alpha_i D_t I(i \in T) + c_i + \delta_t + F_t \lambda_i + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

Substituting in our model for $Y_it$ and expanding the difference operator leads to Equation \ref{eq:3fullte}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3fullte}
    \begin{split}
         \hat{\alpha} =\sum_{i \in T} \alpha_i + &(c_i - c_i) + (\delta_{15} - \delta_{14}) + \lambda_i * (F_{15} - F_{14}) + (\epsilon_{i,15} - \epsilon_{i,14})  \\
         - \sum_{j \in C} w_j [ &(c_j - c_j) + (\delta_{15} - \delta_{14}) + \lambda_j * (F_{15} - F_{14}) + (\epsilon_{j,15} - \epsilon_{j,14})]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The $c$'s drop out due to the time differing. Given that $\sum_{i \ in T}1 = \sum_{j \in C} w_j$, the deltas in treated and control also cancel out eachother. The $\epsilon$'s are assumed to be mean zero, so as $T$ and $C$ get large, these also drop out, leaving us with Equation \ref{eq:4reducedte}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:4reducedte}
         \hat{\alpha} &=\sum_{i \in T} \alpha_i + \lambda_i * (F_{15} - F_{14}) 
         - \sum_{j \in C} w_j \lambda_j * (F_{15} - F_{14}) \nonumber\\
                     &=\sum_{i \in T} \alpha_i + \bigg(\sum_{i \in T}\lambda_i - \sum_{j \in C} w_j \lambda_j\bigg) * (F_{15} - F_{14})
\end{align}

The remaining bias terms are a function of the disparity in the treated and untreated factor loadings $\lambda$. This is where the synthetic control method intuition comes in: if we match on pretreatment outcome values, then as $T$, $C$ and the number of pretreatment periods we match on get larger, the average difference between treated and untreated factor loadings $\lambda$ goes to zero. The idea is that with just one pretreatment period you might still be able to find a set of weights $w_j$ such that treated and untreated firms with different factor loadings match due to compensating idiosyncratic $\epsilon$'s. As the pretreatment period becomes longer, this becomes increasingly unlikely (given time constant weights). Instead, this only remains possible if your matching algorithm achieved matches by picking controls firms such that the weighted sum of their factor loadings $\sum_{j \in C} w_j \lambda_j$ equals the sum of the treated factor loadings $\sum_{i \in T}\lambda_i$. Under that assumption, Equation \ref{eq:4reducedte} reduces to Equation \ref{eq:5success}, where all bias terms have been accounted for.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5success}
    \hat{\alpha} = \sum_{i \in T}\alpha_i
\end{equation}
